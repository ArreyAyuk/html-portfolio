<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Arrey — an energetic and continuously developing web developer. My journey with web development started out of curiosity and a desire to learn how the internet works. Over time, that curiosity grew into an appreciation for building websites not only functional in design but also user-friendly and visually engaging.

I am currently practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learning more about newer frameworks like React and Vue.js. From developing responsive layouts to adding dynamic functions, I enjoy the creative problem-solving that comes with coding.

I'm a strong believer in continuous learning, and I'm constantly researching new technologies to keep myself upgraded. My dream is to become a full-stack developer and work on meaningful projects that transform lives.

Aside from coding, you'll probably find me learning about new tech trends, working on side projects, or collaborating with other developers to learn and share ideas.
</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I am all about staying active. Soccer and the gym are two of my favorite ways to relax and keep energized. I like the camaraderie and strategic aspect of soccer, and that same mentality carries over into my development work — consistently seeking out improvement, staying consistent, and pushing boundaries.</p>

<p>
  working out isn't just a hobby of mine — it's a lifestyle. Whether I'm lifting, doing calisthenics, or slogging through a torturous HIIT workout, training keeps me sharp, disciplined, and energized.</p>
  Later in life, I have high goals:

<ul>
<li>Become a full-stack developer with skills in front-end as well as back-end technologies</li>

<li>Create real-world projects that solve real-world issues and improve user experiences</li>

<li>Code for open-source communities and collaborate with other developers worldwide</li>

<li>Build my own web applications that showcase both my ingenuity and the skills I've developed</li>

<li>And ultimately mentor others just beginning to code — as I did once upon a time</li>
</ul>

<p>Each line of code that I write, each exercise that I finish, and each challenge that I overcome pushes me one step further toward the person and coder I strive to be.</p>

<p>Let's build something incredible together! Feel free to connect with me.</p>
